[Ink](http://www.inklestudios.com/ink) is [inkle](http://www.inklestudios.com/)'s scripting language for writing interactive narrative, both for text-centric games as well as more graphical games that contain highly branching stories. It's designed to be easy to learn, but with powerful enough features to allow an advanced level of structuring.

Here's a taster [from the tutorial](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md).

    - I looked at Monsieur Fogg 
    *   ... and I could contain myself no longer.
        'What is the purpose of our journey, Monsieur?'
        'A wager,' he replied.
        * *     'A wager!'[] I returned.
                He nodded. 
                * * *   'But surely that is foolishness!'
                * * *  'A most serious matter then!'
                - - -   He nodded again.
                * * *   'But can we win?'
                        'That is what we will endeavour to find out,' he answered.
                * * *   'A modest wager, I trust?'
                        'Twenty thousand pounds,' he replied, quite flatly.
                * * *   I asked nothing further of him then[.], and after a final, polite cough, he offered nothing more to me. <>
        * *     'Ah[.'],' I replied, uncertain what I thought.
        - -     After that, <>
    *   ... but I said nothing[] and <> 
    - we passed the day in silence.
    - -> END
